                                                        command to run on a specific GPU.
    [-C | --default-compute-instance]: Create compute instance with the default profile when used
                                       with the option to create a GPU instance (-cgi).
    [-cgi | --create-gpu-instance]: Create GPU instances for the given profile tuples. A profile
                                    tuple consists of a profile name or ID and an optional placement
                                    specifier, which consists of a colon and a placement start index.
                                    Provide comma separated values for more than one profile tuple.
                                    Option -i can be used to restrict the command to run on
                                    a specific GPU.
    [-dgi | --destroy-gpu-instance]: Destroy GPU instances.
                                     Options -i and -gi can be used individually or combined
                                     to restrict the command to run on a specific GPU or GPU
                                     instance.
    [-lgi | --list-gpu-instances]: List GPU instances.
                                   Option -i can be used to restrict the command to run on a
                                   specific GPU.
    [-lcip | --list-compute-instance-profiles]: List supported compute instance profiles.
                                                Options -i and -gi can be used individually or
                                                combined to restrict the command to run on a
                                                specific GPU or GPU instance.
    [-cci | --create-compute-instance]: Create compute instance for the given profile name or IDs.
                                        Provide comma separated values for more than one profile.
                                        If no profile name or ID is given, then the default*
                                        compute instance profile ID will be used. Options -i and
                                        -gi can be used individually or combined to restrict the
                                        command to run on a specific GPU or GPU instance.
    [-dci | --destroy-compute-instance]: Destroy compute instances.
                                         Options -i, -gi and -ci can be used individually or
                                         combined to restrict the command to run on a specific
                                         GPU or GPU instance or compute instance.
    [-lci | --list-compute-instances]: List compute instances.
                                       Options -i and -gi can be used individually or combined
                                       to restrict the command to run on a specific GPU or GPU
                                       instance.
